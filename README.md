🔴 Red Team / Offensive Security Engineer

I operate with a red team mindset: understand systems deeply, break assumptions, and exploit real-world weaknesses — not lab-only vulnerabilities.

I have 2+ years of hands-on experience in Python development and full-stack engineering, which I actively use for:

Building custom offensive tooling

Automating reconnaissance and exploitation

Identifying logic flaws and misconfigurations beyond automated scanners

I hold the CEH certification, but my focus is practical exploitation and attacker thinking, not theory memorization.

My work revolves around:

Web application attacks (auth flaws, logic bugs, API abuse)

Network traffic analysis & protocol behavior

Red team tradecraft: recon → access → persistence → impact

Python-based automation for offensive security

I don’t believe in “movie-style hacking.”
95% is understanding the target. 5% is execution.

This GitHub is used to document:

Offensive security experiments

Custom scripts & tooling

Red team research and notes

Real attack-surface analysis

💻 Tech Stack
🧠 Languages & Scripting

Python — offensive tooling, automation, exploit development

⚠️ Philosophy

Tools don’t make attackers — thinking does

Scanners find noise — humans find impact

Every system fails where assumptions live
