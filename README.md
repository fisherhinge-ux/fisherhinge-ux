# 🔴 Red Team / Offensive Security Engineer

Breaking systems by understanding how they *actually* work.

I focus on **offensive security**, attack-surface discovery, and exploitation driven by logic flaws — not tool spam or lab-only vulnerabilities.

> 95% understanding the target. 5% execution.

## 🧠 Focus Areas
- Web & API exploitation
- Authentication & business logic flaws
- Reconnaissance & attack-surface mapping
- WAF & defense behavior analysis
- Python-based red team tooling

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 attack-surface-mapper
Automated reconnaissance framework that maps domains, infrastructure, technologies, and potential attack paths.

**Focus:** Recon → context → exploitation planning  
**Tech:** Python, Bash, DNS, HTTP analysis

---

### 🔹 api-abuse-lab
Practical research on API vulnerabilities including BOLA, token abuse, mass assignment, and rate-limit bypass.

**Focus:** Modern API attack surfaces  
**Tech:** Python, Postman, Swagger/OpenAPI

---

### 🔹 waf-behavior-analysis
Experimental framework to analyze WAF behavior against mutated payloads, headers, and protocol edge cases.

**Focus:** Detection logic & bypass conditions  
**Tech:** Python, HTTP mutation, response analysis

## 🔬 Research & Notes

- API authorization failures in real-world apps
- Authentication flow abuse patterns
- WAF trust assumptions & header misuse
- TCP/IP behavior from an attacker’s perspective
- Recon mistakes that lead to missed compromise paths

> Notes are written from an attacker’s POV, not defensive theory.

- Tools don’t create impact — understanding does
- Scanners find noise, attackers find logic
- Every breach starts with a wrong assumption
